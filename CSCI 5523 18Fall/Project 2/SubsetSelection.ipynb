The arbitrageur said the equity portion\\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\\n    Redstone\\'s newest plan raised the amount of interest he\\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\\neight pct interest.\\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\\ncompany,\" one said.

While consumer countries are welcome\\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\naccept the producers\\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\\nnot be imposed now.

Analysts\\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \\ndiffered sharply over the carmaker\\'s long term prospects.\\n    \"I\\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\\nPeabody and Co. \"They\\'re clearly committed to enhancing\\nshareholder value.\"\\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\\nrecapture lost market share.\\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\\ngood performance expected from new car models.\\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\\n    \"The buyback doesn\\'t really change the earnings outlook and\\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\\nHealy\\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\\'s share of the domestic\\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and\\nChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February\\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\\nimprovement in coming months.\\n    Overall, GM\\'s share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\\n    Kidder Peabody\\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and product\\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\\'s rolling up\\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think there\\'s a major\\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\\n    Another positive for the stock is GM\\'s dividend, currently\\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM\\'s new products, if\\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\\nmarket share.\\n    \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\\nonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\\n    \"I\\'m not looking for improvement this year. This is a\\ntransition year for GM,\" he said.\\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\\naffect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn\\'t so much what they\\nearn this year.

But it\\ngave no figures.\\n    But one source close to Opec indicated that February output\\nmay have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.\\n    The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around\\n16 mln bpd.\\n    Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8\\nmln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.\\n    Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all\\nproduced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said\\nit would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December\\npact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.\\n    Lukman said that some industry reports \"may be correct\" that\\nin February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238\\nmln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln\\nallocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.\\n    He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his\\ncountry were coming under price pressure because they were\\ncurrently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and\\nthe United States\" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.\\n    However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that\\ndemand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons\\nand expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.\\n    \"We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is\\nnow firming on actual fundamentals,\" he said, adding that he\\nexpected it to go \"up and up\" even beyond official prices after\\nearly April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand\\nfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.\\n    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela\\nand Indonesia were having less problems with output than\\nproducers like his own country because they exported oil\\nproducts.\\n    Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec\\npricing system, he said.\\n    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift\\nsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks\\nand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually\\nhave to buy Opec oil.\\n    \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)\\nthey will realise they should buy now instead of paying more\\nlater on,\" he said.\\n    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being\\npressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was\\nimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,\\nflexible and under constant review, not only when the market\\nseemed weak.\\n    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation\\nministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that\\nsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority\\nfor Opec at the moment.\\n    \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\\n\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is\\nworking, not dealing with a differential of cents between\\ngrades.\"\\n    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over\\nthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\\n Reuter\\n\\x03',\n",
